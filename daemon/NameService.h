/**
 * @brief API to provide an implementation dependent Name Service for AllJoyn.
 *
 * The basic goal of this class is to provide a way for AllJoyn daemons, clients
 * and services to find an IP address and socket to use when connecting to
 * other daemons, clients and services.
 *
 * To first approximation, what we want is to allow a user of AllJoyn to search
 * for IP addresses and ports of daemons that provide some AllJoyn service, as
 * defined by a well-known or bus name.
 *
 * For example, a client may come up and ask, "where is an AllJoyn daemon that
 * implements the org.freedesktop.yadda bus name?  The name service may
 * respond, for example, "one is at IP address 10.0.0.1, listening on port
 * 9955 and another is at IP address 10.0.0.2, listening on port 9955".  The
 * client can then do a TCP connect to one of those addresses and ports.

     * need to specify how to called back when a service appears, disappears
     * or reaffirms its existence on the network.  This method provides the
     * mechanism for specifying the callback.
     *
     * The method singature for the Callback method must be:
     *
     * @code
     *     void Found(const qcc::String &, const qcc::String &, std::vector<qcc::String> &, uint8_t);
     * @endcode

     * The first parameter is the address and port of the found service,
     * formatted as a bus address the way AllJoyn likes, for example,
     * "tcp:addr=192.168.0.1,port=9955".  The second parameter is the daemon
     * guid string exported by the remote daemon service, or the empty string
     * if that daemon didn't bother to export the string.  The third parameter
     * is a vector of qcc::String that represent the well-known names that the
     * remote daemon is referring to, for example, "org.freedesktop.Yadda".
     * The fourth parameter is the timer value.  A timer value of zero indicates
     * that the names provided in the vectoror qcc::String are no longer
     * available.  A timer value of 255 indicates that the names provided should
     * be interpreted as always available, to the extent that is possible.
     * A timer value between 0 and 255 indicates the number of seconds that the
     * name is expected to be valid.  There will be keepalive messages provided
     * which may extend this time periodically.
     *
     * The typical idiom for using the callback facility is to define a method
     * to receive a found callback in your class and instantiate your class
     * (and this one) somewhere:
     *
     * @code
     *     class MyClass:
     *     public:
     *         void Found(const qcc::String &s, const qcc::String &g, std::vector<qcc::String>& wkn, uint8_t timer) {}

     *     ...
     *
     *     MyClass myClass;
     *     NameService nameService;
     * @endcode
     *
     * The callback is connected using the SetCallback() method of this
     * class.
     *
     * @code
     *    nameService.SetCallback(new CallbackImpl<MyClass, void,
     *         const qcc::String &, const qcc::String &, std::vector<qcc::string>, uint8_t>(MyClass, myclass));
     * @endcode
     *
     * From this point forward, all changes to services specified by the

     *
     * To stop notifications, set the callback (cb) to the pointer value 0.
     *
     * @warning The callback will be in the context of a different thread than
     * your thread, so your Found callback code must be multithread safe (or aware
     * at least).
     *
     * @warning Services may come and go constanly during real network operation.
     * Just because a service was found on the network it does not mean that there
