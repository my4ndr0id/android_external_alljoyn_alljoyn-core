// ============================================================================
// Long sidebar on why this looks so complicated:
//
// In order to understand all of the trouble we are going to go through below,
// it is helpful to thoroughly understand what is done on our platforms in the
// presence of multicast.  This is long reading, but worthwhile reading if you
// are trying to understand what is going on.  I don't know of anywhere you
// can find all of this written in one place.
//
// The first thing to grok is that all platforms are implemented differently.
// Windows and Linux use IGMP to enable and disable multicast, and use other
// multicast-related socket calls to do the fine-grained control.  Android
// doesn't bother to compile its kernel with CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST set.  This
// doesn't mean that there is no multicast code in the Android kernel, it means
// there is no IGMP code in the kernel.  Since IGMP isn't implemented, Android
// can't use it to enable and disable multicast at the driver level, so it uses
// wpa_supplicant driver-private commands instead.  This means that you will
// probably get three different answers if you ask how some piece of the
// multicast puzzle works.
//
// On the send side, multicast is controlled by the IP_MULTICAST_IF (or for
// IPv6 IPV6_MULTICAST_IF) socket.  In IPv4 you provide an IP address and in
// IPv6 you provide an interface index.  These differences are abstracted in
// the qcc code and there you are asked to provide an interface name, which the
// abstraction function uses to figure out the appropriate address or index
// depending on the address family.  Unfortunately, you can't abstract away
// the operating system differences in how they interpret the calls; so you
// really need to understand what is happening at a low level in order to get
// the high level multicast operations to do what you really want.
//
// If you do nothing (leave the sockets as you find them), or set the interface
// address to 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or the interface index to 0 for IPv6 the
// multicast output interface is essentially selected by the system routing
// code.
//
// In Linux (and Android), multicast packets are sent out the interface that is
// used for the default route (the default interface).  You can see this if you
// type "ip ro sh".  In Windows, however, the system chooses its default
// interface by looking for the lowest value for the routing metric for a
// destination IP address of 224.0.0.0 in its routing table.  You can see this
// in the output of "route print".
//
// We want all of our multicast code to work in the presence of IP addresses
// changing when phones move from one Wifi access point to another, or when our
// desktop access point changes when someone with a mobile access point walks
// by; so it is also important to know what will happen when these addresses
// change (or come up or go down).
//
// On Linux, if you set the IP_MULTICAST_IF to 0.0.0.0 (or index 0 in IPv6) and
// bring down the default interface or change the IP address on the default
// interface, you will begin to fail the multicast sends with "network
// unreachable" errors since the default route goes away when you change the IP
// address (e.g, just do somthing like "sudo ifconfig eth1 10.4.108.237 netmask
// 255.255.255.0 up to change the address).  Until you provide a new default
// route (e.g., "route add default gw 10.4.108.1") the multicast packets will be
// dropped, but as soon as a new default route is set, they will begin flowing
// again.
//
// In Windows, if you set the IP_MULTICAST_IF address to 0.0.0.0 and release the
// ip address (e.g., "ipconfig /release") the sends may still appear to work at
// the level of the program but nothing goes out the original interface.  The
// sends fail silently.  This is because Windows will dynamically change the
// default multicast route according to its internal multicast routing table.
// It selects another interface based on a routing metric, and it could, for
// example, just switch to a VMware virtual interface silently.  The name
// service would never know it just "broke" and is no longer sending packets out
// the interface it thinks it is.
//
// When we set up multicast advertisements in our system, we most likely do not
// want to route our advertisements only to the default adapter.  For example,
// on a desktop system, the default interface is probably one of the wired
// Ethernets.  We may or many not want to advertise on that interface, but we
// may also want to advertise on other wired interfaces and other wireless
// interfaces as well.
//
// We do not want the system to start changing multicast destinations out from
// under us, EVER.  Because of this, the only time using INADDR_ANY would be
// appropriate in the IP_MULTICAST_IF socket option is in the simplest, static
// network situations.  For the general case, we really need to keep multiple
// sockets that are each talking to an INTERFACE of interest (not an IP address
// of interest, since they can change at any time because of normal access point
// dis-associations, for example).
//
// Since we determined that we needed to use IP_MULTICAST_IF to control which
// interfaces are used for discovery, we needed to understand exactly what
// changing an IP address out from under a corresponding interface would do.
//
// The first thing we observed is that IP_MULTICAST_IF takes an IP address in
// the case of IPv4, but we wanted to specify an interface index as in IPv6 or
// for mere mortal human beings, a name (e.g., "wlan0").  It may be the case
// that the interface does not have an IP address assigned (is not up or
// connected to an access point) at the time we want to start our name service,
// so a call to set the IP_MULTICAST_IF (via the appropriate abstract qcc call)
// would not be possible until an address is available, perhaps an arbitrary
// unknowable time later.  If sendto() operations are attempted and the IP
// address is not valid one will see "network unreachable" errors.  As we will
// discuss shortly, joining a multicast group also requires an IP address in the
// case of IPv4 (need to send IGMP Join messages), so it is not possible to
// express interest in receiving multicast packets until an IP address is
// available.
//
// So we needed to provide an API that allows a user to specify a network
// interface over which she is interested in advertising.  This explains the
// method OpenInterface(qcc::String interface) defined below.  The client is
// expected to figure out which interfaces it wants to do discovery over (e.g.,
// "wlan0", "eth0") and explicitly tell the name service which interfaces it is
// interested in.  We clearly need a lazy evaluation mechanism in the name
// service to look at the interfaces which the client expresses interest in, and
// when IP addresses are available, or change, we begin using those interfaces.
// If the interfaces go down, or change out from under the name service, we need
// to deal with that fact and make things right.
//
// We can either hook system "IP address changed" or "interface state changed"
// events to drive the re-evaluation process as described above, or we can poll
// for those changes.  Since the event systems in our various target platforms
// are wildly different, creating an abstract event system is non-trivial (for
// example, a DBus-based network manager exists on Linux, but even though
// Android is basically Linux and has DBus, it doesn't use it.  You'd need to
// use Netlink sockets on most Posix systems, but Darwin doesn't have Netlink.
// Windows is from another planet.
//
// Because of all of these complications, we just choose the better part of
// valor and poll for changes using a maintenance thread that fires off every
// second and looks for changes in the networking environment and adjusts
// accordingly.
//
// We could check for IP address changes on the interfaces and re-evaluate and
// open new sockets bound to the correct interfaces whenever an address change
// happens.  It is possible, however, that we could miss the fact that we have
// switched access points if DHCP gives us the same IP address.  Windows, for
// example, could happily begin rerouting packets to other interfaces if one
// goes down.  If the interface comes back up on a different access point, which
// gives out the same IP address, Windows could bring us back up but leave the
// multicast route pointing somewhere else and we would never notice.  Because
// of these byzantine kinds of errors, we chose the better part of valor and
// decided to close all of our multicast sockets down and restart them in a
// known state periodically.
//
// The receive side has similar kinds of issues.
//
// In order to receive multicast datagrams sent to a particular port, it is
// necessary to bind that local port leaving the local address unspecified
// (i.e., INADDR_ANY or in6addr_any).  What you might think of as binding is
// then actually handled by the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) or its
// ICMPv6 equivalent.  Recall that Android does not implement IGMP, so we have
// yet another complication.
//
// Using IGMP, we join the socket to the multicast group instead of binding the
// socket to a specific interface (address) and port.  Binding the socket to
// INADDR_ANY or in6addr_any may look strange, but it is actually the right
// thing to do.  Since joining a multicast group requires sending packets over
// the IGMP protocol, we need a valid IP address in order to do the join.  As
// mentioned above, an interface must be IFF_UP with an assigned IP address in
// order to join a multicast group.
//
// The socket option for joining a multicast group, of course, works differently
// for IPv4 and IPv6.  IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (for IPv4) has a provided IP address
// that can be either INADDR_ANY or a specific address.  If INADDR_ANY is
// provided, the interface of the default route is added to the group, and the
// IGMP join is sent out that interface.  IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (for IPv6) has a
// provided interface index that can be either 0 or a specific interface.  If 0
// is provided, the interface of the default route is added to the group, and
// the IGMP Join (actually an ICMPv6 equivalent) is sent out that interface.  If
// a specific interface index is that interface is added to the group and the
// IGMP join is sent out that interface.  Note that since an ICMP packet is sent,
// the interface must be IFF_UP with an assigned IP address even though the
// interface is specified by an index.
//
// A side effect of the IGMP join deep down in the kernel is to enable reception
// of multicast MAC addresses in the device driver.  Since there is no IGMP in
// Android, we must rely on a multicast (Java) lock being taken by some external
// code on phones that do not leave multicast always enabled (HTC Desire, for
// example).  When the Java multicast lock is taken, a private driver command is
// sent to the wpa_supplicant which, in turn, calls into the appropriate network
// device driver(s) to enable reception of multicast MAC packets.  This is
// completely out of our control here.
//
// Similar to the situation on the send side, we most likely do not want to rely
// on the system routing tables to configure which network interfaces our name
// service receives over; so we really need to provide a specific address.
//
// If a specific IP address is provided, then that address must be an address
// assigned to a currently-UP interface.  This is the same catch-22 as we have
// on the send side.  We need to lazily evaluate the interface in order to find
// if an IP address has appeared on that interface and then join the multicast
// group to enable multicast on the underlying network device.
//
// It turns out that in Linux, the IP address passed to the join multicast group
// socket option call is actually not significant after the initial call.  It is
// used to look up an interface and its associated net device and to then set
// the PACKET_MULTICAST filter on the net device to receive packets destined for
// the specified multicast address.  If the IP address associated with the
// interface changes, multicast messages will continue to be received.
//
// Of course, Windows does it differently.  They look at the IP address passed
// to the socket option as being significant, and so if the underlying IP
// address changes on a Windows system, multicast packets will no longer be
// delivered.  Because of this, the receive side of the multicast name service
// has also got to look for changes to IP address configuration and re-set
// itself whenever it finds a change.
//
// So the code you find below may look overly complicated, but (hopefully most
// of it, anyway) needs to be that way.
//
// As an aside, the daemon that owns us can be happy as a clam by simply binding
// to INADDR_ANY since the semantics of this action, as interpreted by both
// Windows and Linux, are to listen for connections on all current and future
// interfaces and their IP addresses.  The complexity is fairly well contained
// here.
